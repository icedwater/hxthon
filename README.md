# hxthon

Build a hackathon management engine because using hackathon.io kind of hurt.
This will be open-sourced because many heads are better than one, and I want
hackathons to be more about exchanging ideas and working on projects, rather
than tripping up on the nitty-gritty details.

Ideas are always welcome, though they may not necessarily be adopted. But if
they are adopted, credit will be given.

I think a permissive license will help adoption much more than a strict one.

## Components

- team management
- project flow
- deliverables
- hackathon management
- messaging platform
